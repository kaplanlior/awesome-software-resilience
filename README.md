### C#
[Polly](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly) ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/App-vNext/Polly) ![GitHub Latest Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/App-vNext/Polly?logo=github) <br>
Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.

### Go
[go-resiliency](https://github.com/eapache/go-resiliency) ![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/eapache/go-resiliency) ![GitHub Latest Release)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/eapache/go-resiliency?logo=github) <br>
go-resiliency has Resiliency patterns for golang. Based in part on Hystrix, Semian, and others.


### JavaScript

Opossum is a Node.js circuit breaker that executes asynchronous functions and monitors their execution status. When things start failing, opossum plays dead and fails fast. If you want, you can provide a fallback function to be executed when in the failure state.

### Ruby
